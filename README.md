---

## Overview
The Poem Classification system leverages natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to categorize poems into predefined genres.

Key features:

- Text classification using deep learning models (LSTM, CNN, Transformers).

- Preprocessing of poetic text using tokenization and word embeddings.

- Model trained on a diverse poem dataset.

- Web-based interface for poem classification.

- Model Performance

Evaluation Metrics:

- Accuracy Score: Measures the correctness of classifications.

- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Ensures balanced performance evaluation.

Model Training Details:

- Word Embedding: Pre-trained GloVe or Word2Vec.

- Model Architectures: LSTM, Bi-LSTM, CNN, Transformers.

- Dataset: Collected poetry dataset from multiple sources.

---

## Motivation

Poetry is a unique form of text that expresses emotions, and classifying it into different genres helps in literary analysis,
recommendation systems, and educational tools. This project showcases the power of deep learning in text classification.
---

## Technical Aspect
### Training Recommendation Model:
Data Collection:

- containing poetry texts and their genres.

Preprocessing:

- Cleaning text by removing special characters and stopwords.

- Tokenization and conversion to numerical representations using word embeddings.

Model Training:

- Training deep learning models to classify poems.

- Applying model tracking using MLflow for experiment tracking and logging.

Web Application:

- A Flask-based web app for user interaction.

- Deployed on Render for public access.
---

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. Install the required packages and libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
To run the Flask web app locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Deployment on Render

To deploy the Flask web app on Render:
- Push your code to GitHub.
- Log in to Render and create a new web service.
- Connect the GitHub repository.
- Configure environment variables (if any).
- Deploy and access your app live.
